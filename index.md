Welcome to The PyRoll Project!

PyRoll is an OpenSource rolling framework, aimed to provide a fast and extensible base for rolling simulation. The
current focus lies on groove rolling in elongation grooves. The core packages comes with a basic set of models to allow
a first estimation of forces and torques occurring in a pass sequence. There is a flexible plugin system, able to modify
and extend the model set available to describe the process.
