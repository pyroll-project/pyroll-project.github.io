We online now!

The core package and a bunch of basic extensions is now published online on [GitHub](https://github.com/pyroll-project)
under BSD-3-Clause license. The packages are installable via PiPy using `pip`:

    pip install pyroll
    pip install pyroll-wusatowski-spreading
    pip install pyroll-integral-thermal
    pip install pyroll-freiberg-flow-stress

So just get them and try it out. If you have questions or want to contribute, don't hesitate to contact us via the issue
system of our source repositories or via [mail](mailto:kalibrierzentrum@imf.tu-freiberg.de).

News and updates will be announced in future at this place.

Happy rolling!
