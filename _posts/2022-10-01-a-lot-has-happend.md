Since our last post from March this year, a lot has happened.
We published more packages to further extended the use cases of the project.
Some of them focus on spreading, like the `pyroll-marini-spreading` or `pyroll-sander-spreading` model package. 
Other focus on extending the framework regarding influences from the rolling mill like the famous Hitchcock model used for roll flattening. 
Besides this we worked on a publication which we hope to be accepted in [steel research international](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1869344x?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paidsearch&utm_campaign=R78D96W) this year.
Furthermore, we held our first seminar the Freiberger Kalibreurstag which gave us the chance to demonstrate the capabilities of PyRolL to colleagues from the industry.

Now we are in preparation for the [AIKW](http://www.aikw.org/index.php/conferences) and [Rolling-12](https://www.aimnet.it/rolling-12/) conference where we be giving talks focusing on the projects development and usage.
If you are participating these conferences as well, don't hesitate to ask questions if you have some.
If you're not participating and want to contact us please write use an issue or contact us via [mail](mailto:kalibrierzentrum@imf.tu-freiberg.de)


In the future we want to post here once a month, so stay tuned and Happy rolling!
